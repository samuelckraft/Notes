HTML is the stage set-up for the world wide web
    -foundation of everything that is built, and structure that holds it all together

    -html acts like the websites skeleton, providing a framework for elements like CSS (costumes and stage design) and Javascript (special effects)

    -html is like a plays script where each instruction is wrapped in 'tags'
        -tags - basic directions given to "actors" on stage (e.g. <p> is a tag that tells the browser to start a new paragraph)

elements - complete instructions in the script, including both tags and content
    -e.g. <p> Hello <p> (<p> are tags while Hello is the content)

attributes - provide additional info about elements, akin to a director adding specifics to a scene like emotion or actions
    -reside in the opening tag and are composed of attribute name and value
    
    -e.g. <img src="stage.jpg" alt="Theater Stage"> is an image element where src (source of the image) and alt (alternative text) provide more details about the image element

*Not every tag requires a closing tag

*CREATING A BASIC HTML PAGE STRUCTURE
    -DOCTYPE - like the curtain raiser, letting the browser know "get ready, and HTML5 performance is starting"
        <!DOCTYPE html>

    -<html> tag - signifies start and ending of your html document
        -<head> section - like theater marquee, gives info about the show but not actual content
            -in the head there is metadata, such as <title>, which will appear in the browser's title bar or tab
            - can also have links to stylesheets like instructions for costume and set designers

        -<body> section - core of the html document; the real performance, where everything the user interacts with is placed (text, images, videos, links, buttons, etc.)


Meta Tags - provide important details about the "performance" but are not visible to the user
    - act as guides for search engines and browsers to understand and display the content effectively

    Common meta tags
        - charset - specifies the character encoding for the html document, ensuring correct character display
            <meta charset="UTF-8"> 

        - viewport - crucial for all responsive design, ensuring proper display on all devices
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1.0">

        - description - concise summary of the page's content, crucial for SEO
            <meta name="description" content="A warm welcome to our digital theater, shwocasign the 'Hello World' of HTML">
        
        - keywords - helps search engines understand the main topics of your page
            <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, helloworld, webdevelopment, theater">

        - author - credits the creator of the html document
            <meta name="author" content="Sam Kraft"
