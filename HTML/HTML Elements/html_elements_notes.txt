Tables - structuring data
    - <table> - creates the shelf
    - Table row <tr> - defines the rrows (think of thems as shelves)
    - Table header <th> used for headers (like category labels)
    - Table data <tdr> - represents the individual cells (books on the shelf)

Blockquotes/inline quotes
    - <blockquotes> - used for longer quotes
    - <q> - used for shorterm inline quotations; don't need to put quotes in the code

Code/preformatted text
    - <code> - used for inline code elements
    - <pre> - preserves formatting, which is ideal for larger code blocks; meaning if we indent our code, it indents the text on the webpage

iframe
    - allows us to put a browser page in our browser page
    - have to change the watch in the web address to embed


Semantic HTML5
    - like cues in a theatrical production, directing not just the presentation of content, but also imbuing it with significance and origanization

    - Common semantic elements
        - <header> - acts as intro to your page or a section of it; often contains nav bar, logos, and introductory content

        - <footer> - houses contact info, copyright notices, and links to legal info or related docs

        - <article> - used for self-contained composition in a document, page or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable

        - <section> - like a distinct act in a play, grouping related content together; could be chapters, headers, footers or any other sections of the document

        - <nav> - navigation; akin to a directory or map of the play, guiding user through web page's different scenes/sections

        - <aside> - used for tangentially related content, similar to a sidebar conversation or an aside in a play that complements the main content, like related links


New Elements in HTML5

    - <figure> and <figcaption>
        - <figure> is used to represent self-contained content, often referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document
            - e.g. images, diagrams, code snippets, etc.
        
        - <figcaption> allows for a caption or description to be directly associated with the figure

    - <main>
        - represents dominant content of the <body> of a document

        - intended for content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, excluding content repeated across pages like headers/footers
