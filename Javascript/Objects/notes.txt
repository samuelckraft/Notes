Objects
    - can access object properties through dot or bracket notation

    - object methods - allow you to encapsulate functionality within the object

    - 'this' keyword - refers to the current object context; by using this you can accss and manilpulate properties and methods within the object

    - constructors and prototypes - serve as blueprints for creating objects with similar properties and methods
        - constructors - initialize object properties

        - prototypes - define shared methods across multiple objects

    Built-in Objects
        Math object
            - holds arithmetic function (add, subtract, multiply and divide)

            - holds constants (pi and Euler's number)

            - holds solutions for more complex function (rounding, absolute values, random numbers)

        Date object
            - lets us handle dates, times and everything in between
