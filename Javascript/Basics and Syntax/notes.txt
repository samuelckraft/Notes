    Statements
        - use ; to terminate statements, {} to define blocks of code, and () to enclose expressions

    
Variables
    - containers for storing data

    Declaring Variables
        - var - used before let and const came around but is avoided now
            - function level scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the function they're declared in

            - ability to reassign and re-declarevariables in the same scope without errors

        - let - allows value reassignment; block scope, meaning they are only accessible in the blcok they are declared in
            - can be reassigned within the same block but cannot be re-declared in the same scope
            - not "hoistes", meaning they are not accessible before their declaration in the code

        - const - constants and immutable values
            - block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or redeclared within the same scope
