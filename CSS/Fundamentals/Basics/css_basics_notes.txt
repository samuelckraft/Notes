Metaphor: stepping into art gallery where HTML sets the stage and CSS enhances each display with colors, styles and sizes

CSS - acts as the stylist of the web, defining how HTML elements appear on screen

CSS syntax - set of rules that define styles for HTML elements

    selectors - pinpoint the HTML elements you want to style; act like tags labeling each art piece in our digital gallery

        - class selectors
            - like fabric patterns, applied to multiple elements to unify their design

            - use .classname

            - e.g. .special-text {color: darkcyan; font-weight: bold;}

        - ID selectors
            - custom fits, unique for styling singular elements

            - use #idname

            - e.g. #main-heading{color: darkmagenta; font-size: 24px;}

        - !important rule
            - override button in our kit; it's use is best kept minial to avoid CSS chaos

            - e.g. .urgent-text {color: red !important;}

        - grouping selectors
            - can apply a single style to multiple elements at once

            - e.g. h1, h2, h3 {color: red;}

        - combinators
            - specify relationships between selectors, tailoring styles based on their hierarchy and proximity

            - e.g. article p{color: slategray;}     article > p {margin-left: 20px}

        

    declaration blocks - contain one or more declarations separated by semicolons; each declaration includes a css property and value

Incorporating CSS

    Inline CSS
        - like using a fine-tip pen, allowing you to apply styles directly within an HTML tags

        - specific and limited in scope

        - e.g. <h1 style="color: royalblue">Hello World</h1>  #this would just apply to this h1 tag, not all of them

    Internal CSS
        - uses the <style> element in the HTML <head>, acting like a sketchbook where you define styles specifically for that page

        - e.g. <style> body{background-color: lightgray;} p{font-size:16px;} </style>

    External CSS
        - involves linking a separate CSS file to your HTML, comparable to a comprehensive art portfolio

        - promotes reuse and organization

        - e.g.  <head><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"></head>

IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE (more specific is higher priority):
    - !important
    - inline elements
    - id
    - class
    - elements


colors, backgrounds and units
    - units (px, em, rem, %) offer the tape measurer for precise styling
        em - gets the font size of the nearest parent element
        rem - gets the font size based off the body size
        % - refers to the percentage of the parent element

textransform - can capitalize or lowercase entire elements

CSS Box Model
    - set of rules that define layers for every web element, each serving a unique purpose in determining how that element appears on the page

    Layers of the box:

        content - core of the box, the actual item (picture, text, video, etc.)

        padding - like buble wrap, ensuring the contents don't touch the sides of the box (borders)

        borders - visible edge, defining the outer limits of the content; can be styled (colors, solid, dashes, etc.)

        margin - air in a shippping box, its the space between this box and the other elements
