RGBA (Red-Green-Blue-Alpha)
    - first three components control color, but last controls opacity

    - gradients allow us to blend hues together
        * {
        background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,99,71,.5), rgba(255,159,64,.5));}

        ^ transitions screen from semi transparent red on the left to equally transparent orange on the right


        background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,.6), rgba(0,0,255,.6));
        ^ transitions screen going out from the center

            - can also specify direction several ways (to right, to bottom left, 180deg)


Shadow and text effects
    Shadows
        - box shadows - adds depth to web elements
            - e.g. box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2) 
                first number is horizontal shade (shadows to either side), second is vertical (shadows above or below), third is blur (how opaque the shadow fades) and rgba is color

        - text shadow is same as box shadow but with the text in the adapted element
            - text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);

    Effects
        Transitions and Animations
            - transitions is like changing the background color of a button using button {transition: background-color .3s}

            - keyframe animations - allow you to choreograph complex sequences of movement, color and transformations
                e.g. - below example makes the button pulse from 0% being itself, to 1.1 scale of itself, back to itself
                @keyframes pulse {
                    0% {transform: scale(1);}
                    50% {transform: scale(1.1);}
                    100% {transform: scale(1);}
                }

                button {
                    animation: pulse 2s infinite;
                }

                e.g. - below example makes image spin every 10 seconds
                img {
                    animation: rotate 10s infinite linear;
                    border-radius: 100%;
                }

                @keyframes rotate {
                    from {transform: rotate(0deg);}
                    to {transform: rotate(360deg);}
                }
